# CS460 course project

i designed, implemented and documented a database system for a web based photo social sharing application. i need also to provide the web based interface to the database. 

## Phase I - Design

Initially, i must design and create a database for the application. This includes creating tables to store this data, and designing rules for how these tables relate to each other so that the data they store can be combined in meaningful ways. As part of the report for this phase, i turn in an E-R diagram of my database design, and the translation to the relational schema. Also, i have to provide all the constraints and the SQL code that i used to enforce them (CHECK or ASSERTION clauses). 

## Phase II - API Implementation

In this phase, i should write the SQL queries and some Python code that implements an interface to my database and executes the queries. This part used in the next phase for the web interface. 

## Phase III - Web Site Extension

Finally, i create a web site for my database and add the photo sharing functionality.
